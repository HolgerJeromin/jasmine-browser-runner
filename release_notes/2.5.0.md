# jasmine-browser-runner 2.5.0 Release Notes

## Changes

* Allow listen address to be configured separately from hostname

    This allows the hostname to be set in configurations that need to listen
    to a different network interface than the one corresponding to the
    configured hostname, such as when using Saucelabs.

* Bind to localhost in newly generated configs

    This improves security by preventing connections from other computers. The
    old behavior of binding to all network interfaces can still be enabled by
    removing the listenAddress field from the config or setting it to "*".

* Report result to Saucelabs when using remote grid support

    This causes the run to show as Passed or Failed in the Saucelabs
    dashboard. Previously, that only worked when using the deprecated
    legacy Saucelabs support.

* Support .mjs config file extension

* Generate ES module config files instead of JSON

    This allows the use of comments. Because the config files have `.mjs`
    extension, they can be used in both CommonJS and ESM projects.

* Updated minimum Express version
    * Merges [#55](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-browser-runner/pull/55) from @HolgerJeromin

## Documentation improvements

* Fixed type of hostname config prop
* Improved readme intro
* Fixed "Want more control?" example in README
