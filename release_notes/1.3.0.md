# jasmine-browser-runner 1.3.0 Release Notes

## New Features and bug fixes

* Restrict selenium-webdriver to <4.8.0 for compatiblity with Node versions
  before 14.18, which we still support.

* Warn when backslashes are used in globs on Windows. Backslashes behave 
  inconsistently between OSes in the version of glob that jasmine-browser-runner
  currently uses, and the next major version of glob will treat them as escape
  sequences rather than path separators on all OSes.
